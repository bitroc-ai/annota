# Getting Started

Welcome to Annota! This guide will help you integrate Annota into your application and start annotating medical images.

## What You'll Learn

This getting started section covers:

1. **[Installation](/docs/getting-started/installation)** - Install Annota and its dependencies
2. **[Quick Start](/docs/getting-started/quick-start)** - Build your first annotation viewer
3. **[Core Concepts](/docs/getting-started/concepts)** - Understand annotations, layers, and tools

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Node.js** 16+ installed
- **React** 18+ or 19+ in your project
- Basic knowledge of React hooks
- A whole slide image in a supported format (DZI, IIIF, etc.)

## What is Annota?

Annota is a high-performance annotation framework specifically designed for digital pathology and whole slide imaging. It provides:

- **Interactive drawing tools** for creating annotations (points, rectangles, polygons)
- **Layer management** for organizing annotations
- **Event system** for responding to annotation changes
- **Data loaders** for importing annotations from H5, JSON, and other formats
- **High performance rendering** with PixiJS and WebGL

## Architecture Overview

Annota is built on three core technologies:

- **OpenSeadragon**: For displaying gigapixel images
- **PixiJS**: For hardware-accelerated annotation rendering
- **React**: For component-based UI integration

The framework follows a clean separation of concerns:

```
Your React App
    ↓
AnnotaProvider (Context)
    ↓
AnnotaViewer (OpenSeadragon)
    ↓
Annotator (Annotation Layer)
    ↓
Tools (Point, Rectangle, Polygon, etc.)
```

## Typical Workflow

1. **Install** Annota and OpenSeadragon
2. **Wrap** your app with `AnnotaProvider`
3. **Add** `AnnotaViewer` component to display your image
4. **Initialize** the `Annotator` overlay
5. **Use** hooks like `useTool` to activate annotation tools
6. **Access** annotations via `useAnnotations()` hook
