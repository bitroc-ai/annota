# Installation

Install Annota and its peer dependencies in your React project.

## Package Manager

### npm

```bash
npm install annota openseadragon
```

### pnpm

```bash
pnpm add annota openseadragon
```

### yarn

```bash
yarn add annota openseadragon
```

## Peer Dependencies

Annota requires the following peer dependencies:

- **openseadragon**: `^4.0.0 || ^5.0.0`
- **react**: `^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0`
- **react-dom**: `^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0`

These should already be installed in your React project. If not, install them:

```bash
npm install react react-dom openseadragon
```

## TypeScript Support

Annota is written in TypeScript and includes type definitions out of the box. For OpenSeadragon types, install:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/openseadragon
```

## CSS Imports

Import the Annota stylesheet in your application:

```tsx
import 'annota/dist/index.css';
```

Or in your global CSS file:

```css
@import 'annota/dist/index.css';
```

## Verify Installation

Create a simple test file to verify the installation:

```tsx
import { AnnotaProvider } from 'annota';
import 'annota/dist/index.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <AnnotaProvider slideId="test">
      <div>Annota is installed!</div>
    </AnnotaProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

If this compiles without errors, you're ready to go!

## Optional Dependencies

### H5 File Loading

If you plan to load annotations from HDF5 files, `jsfive` is already included as a dependency. No additional installation required.

### OpenCV Integration

For advanced features like contour detection, you may want to install OpenCV.js:

```bash
npm install @techstark/opencv-js
```

See the [Advanced Features](/docs/guides/advanced) guide for more details.

## Troubleshooting

### Module not found errors

If you see module resolution errors, ensure your bundler (webpack, vite, etc.) is configured to resolve the `annota` package correctly.

For Vite, you may need to add to `vite.config.ts`:

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  optimizeDeps: {
    include: ['annota', 'openseadragon']
  }
});
```

### TypeScript errors

If you see TypeScript errors related to OpenSeadragon, make sure you have installed the type definitions:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/openseadragon
```

### CSS not loading

Make sure you're importing the CSS file in your application entry point or component:

```tsx
import 'annota/dist/index.css';
```
