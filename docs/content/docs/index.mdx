# Introduction

Annota is a high-performance annotation framework designed specifically for whole slide imaging (WSI) and digital pathology applications. Built with TypeScript and React, it provides a comprehensive solution for creating, editing, and managing annotations on large-scale medical images.

## Key Features

### High Performance
- **Spatial Indexing**: Efficient R-tree based spatial indexing for fast annotation queries
- **Optimized Rendering**: Smart rendering pipeline for handling thousands of annotations
- **Large Image Support**: Built on OpenSeadragon for seamless gigapixel image viewing

### React First
- **Modern Hooks API**: Intuitive React hooks for annotations, selection, and interactions
- **Component Based**: Pre-built components for common annotation workflows
- **Type Safe**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions

### Extensible Architecture
- **Custom Tools**: Easy-to-implement custom annotation tools (point, rectangle, polygon)
- **Layer System**: Organize annotations into multiple layers with independent styling
- **Plugin System**: Extend functionality with custom shape editors and interactions

### Professional Features
- **Drag-and-Drop Editing**: Visual editing of annotation shapes with handles
- **Smart Popups**: Context-aware popups with adaptive positioning
- **Import/Export**: Support for ASAP XML format and H5 annotations
- **Undo/Redo**: Built-in support for annotation history (planned)

## Use Cases

Annota is designed for:

- **Digital Pathology**: Annotate regions of interest in whole slide images
- **AI Training**: Create and manage training datasets for machine learning models
- **Clinical Workflows**: Support pathologist workflows with annotation tools
- **Research**: Facilitate research with flexible annotation capabilities

## Architecture Overview

Annota follows a clean, layered architecture:
