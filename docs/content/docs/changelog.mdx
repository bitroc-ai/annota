## v0.5.0

Released on October 28, 2025

### Major Features

**Multi-Select Support**: Comprehensive multi-select functionality with Ctrl/Cmd+Click, drag-to-select rectangle, and Ctrl/Cmd+A for select all.

**Merge Tool**: Combine multiple selected annotations into a single annotation using polygon union operations. Accessible via toolbar button (enabled when 2+ annotations selected) or programmatically via `annotator.mergeSelected()`.

**Split Tool**: Cut annotations into multiple pieces using an interactive line drawing tool. Click to add split line vertices, double-click or Enter to execute, Escape to cancel.

### Core Improvements

- New `operations.ts` module with reusable geometry operations
- `MergeCommand` and `SplitCommand` for atomic operations with full undo/redo
- Enhanced selection system with drag-to-select and modifier key support
- Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl/Cmd+A (select all), Escape (clear selection)

### Dependencies

- **Added**: `polygon-clipping` (0.15.7) - Fast polygon boolean operations (~40KB)

### Breaking Changes

None - all new APIs are additive and backward compatible.
