## v0.4.0

Released on October 27, 2025

### New Features

- **Auto-assign Masks to Layers** (âœ¨): Added Sparkles button to toolbar that automatically classifies masks as positive/negative based on contained point annotations
- **16-bit PNG Mask Export**: Added Download button to mask layers for exporting proper 16-bit grayscale PNG masks
- **UI Improvements**: Removed OpenSeadragon focus outline (black border) globally for cleaner interface
- **Simplified Playground**: Removed layer creation/deletion features from playground to reduce complexity

### Technical Improvements

- Exported `containsPoint` and `calculateBounds` utilities from core for external use
