### Advanced Features

- [ ] Measurement tools (distance, area, angle)
- [ ] Annotation locking
- [ ] Annotation groups/hierarchies
- [ ] Collaborative annotations
- [ ] Annotation validation workflow
- [ ] Quality control tools

## Extension System

The extension/plugin system is planned to enable AI models, custom tools, and integrations. For design discussions and proposals, see:

- ðŸ“‹ [Extension System Design Discussion](https://github.com/bitroc-ai/annota/issues) (issue to be created)

## Development Principles

1. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage
2. **Framework Agnostic**: Core logic independent of React/OSD
3. **Performance**: WebGL rendering, spatial indexing
4. **Extensibility**: Plugin system for AI/tools
5. **User Experience**: Intuitive QuPath-like interface
6. **Data Interoperability**: Standard formats (JSON, GeoJSON, H5)
